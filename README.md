The goal of this project is to perform a detailed analysis of the Superstone sales dataset using Microsoft Power BI. Superstone is a fictional company that sells various products, including furniture, office supplies, and technology equipment. The dataset includes information on customer demographics, product categories, sales amounts, and other related information.


- For this project, please find attached the dataset in [Superstone Sales Data.xlsx](https://github.com/nayan1306/PowerBI_Sales_Report/blob/main/global_superstore_2016.xlsx) and, the main project file is [sales_report.pbix(Microsoft Power Bi file)](https://github.com/nayan1306/PowerBI_Sales_Report/blob/main/sales_report.pbix).

The project involves the following steps:

- Data Preparation and Cleansing: In this step, I import the Superstone sales dataset into Power BI and perform some basic data preparation and cleansing tasks to ensure the data is accurate and consistent. I also create relationships between the tables to enable cross-table analysis.

- Data Modeling: In this step, I use Power BI's data modeling tools to create calculated columns and measures that helped me gain insights into the data. I also create hierarchies and custom groupings that enableS better analysis and visualization of the data.

- Data Visualization: In this step, I create interactive and visually appealing reports and dashboards that enables me to analyze the Superstone sales data. I use Power BI's visualization tools to create charts, tables, and other visual elements that will help me gain insights into the data.
